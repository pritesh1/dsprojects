# My Personal Data Science Projects


#Time Series Analysis:

Intro: This is one of my Capstone projects I am working on. The Task is to collect Time Series and explore Forecasting algorithms. I have just shown a simple linear regression and what I want to bring to your attention is how I created a sklearn pipeline using Pythonic objects to implement my application. This was the reason I have been able to scale the platform and deploy multiple time series.

Technologies used: D3.js, Bootstrap, Scikit Learn , Python



#Map Reduce and Natural Language Processing:
Intro: I am introducing this code snippet just to show a little piece of Natural Language processing that I have done using Map Reduce. The key takeaway is that how I could use the Map Reduce paradigm(Actually I just learnt the Python MRjob library to make things simpler). to collect one gram,bi-gram and n-gram of languages on Wikipedia language. I have created a lemmatization model to eventually find out the key words and also used tf-idf.

Technologies used: Python Scikit Learn, MRjob, lxml, Regex etc..

#Spark 

Intro: A very interesting project of analyzing users on StackOverflow. This was one of the assignments I did at the Data Incubator. My task was to categorize users and eventually find out using Natural Language Processing techniques like word2vec to create features and understand what metrics actually keep the users Active on an Online Website. What I want you to make note of is how I used Scikit libraries to track users and implement a K mean classifier on PySpark.

#Network Analysis:

Intro: The Task was to analyze a network of customers why buy products and find out which nodes will be most influential. The key takeaway for this particular assignment is how I minimized (slides 18-23) the computational complexity of the problem cy creating application contours and making it a planar problem. Also, this is one problem which I did within two weeks and learnt Networkx and Graph Libraries.

Technologies used: Networkx, Gephi, CartoDB, Python

#Search Systems

I am currently designing a search engine for images. I can currently retrieve image URL's on a Postgres DataBase. Not very fancy and is under development but I wanted to highlight the way I index images and deploy it on a JVM

Technologies: Postgres and Java


#Anomaly Detection

I have previously worked on Anomaly Detection Systems at Cisco. I cannot share details of the code but the task is to classify anomalies in the Machine Sensors using Machine Learning Algorithms and extracting a feature learning model.


#Image Processing

My Masters Thesis was to classify different Tissue Images .I used  Scale Invariant Feature Transforms and Gaussian Mixture Models to classify labeled images using Support vector Machines.


#Scala
I can also use Scala and have have started implementing it in MapReduce paradigms using Scala. A small example is of creating a html converter for twitter tags where I create a hashtag encoder : https://github.com/pritesh1/dsprojects/tree/master/scala

 Also, I can handle data transactions and am good with Data Definition Languages and SQL backend development.
